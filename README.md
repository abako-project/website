# Work3Spaces (Abako / PolkaTalent)

**Decentralized marketplace for freelancers, built on Polkadot/Virto Network.**

> A client proposes a project, a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) assigns a consultant, the consultant defines the scope with milestones, the client approves, a team is formed, development takes place, work is reviewed and payment is released through a blockchain escrow system.

## About the Project

### What problem does it solve

Imagine you are a company (a **client**) and you need to develop software. Normally you would have to find freelancers on your own, negotiate prices, trust that they deliver on time, and manage payments manually. Work3Spaces solves all of this using **blockchain** (a decentralized, transparent, and immutable digital ledger).

### How it works

```
1. The CLIENT proposes a project (description, budget, deadline)
2. A DAO (community) votes and assigns a CONSULTANT to the project
3. The CONSULTANT defines the SCOPE: divides the project into MILESTONES
4. The CLIENT approves (or rejects) the proposed scope
5. A DEVELOPMENT TEAM is assigned to the milestones
6. Developers work and submit deliverables for review
7. The client reviews and approves each milestone
8. Payment is automatically released from the escrow system
```

### Key Concepts

| Concept | What is it | Why it matters |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| **Blockchain** | A distributed database where no one can alter the records. | Guarantees that payments and agreements are transparent and immutable. |
| **Polkadot** | A network of interconnected blockchains. | It is the infrastructure where our project lives. |
| **Virto Network** | A blockchain within Polkadot, specialized in commerce and payments. | Provides authentication tools (WebAuthn) and payments. |
| **DAO** | Decentralized Autonomous Organization: a group that makes decisions by voting. | Assigns consultants and teams fairly and transparently. |
| **Escrow** | Custody system: money is held until conditions are met. | The client deposits funds, but they are only released when the work is approved. |
| **Milestone** | A partial project deliverable with a defined scope. | Allows dividing work into manageable parts with incremental payments. |
| **WebAuthn** | Passwordless authentication, using biometrics or security keys. | Users register with their device, not with email/password. |
| **SPA** | Single Page Application: a web application that loads once and navigates without reloading the page. | The React frontend is an SPA that communicates directly with the external APIs. |

## Technology Stack

### Frontend (the complete application)

| Technology | Version | What it is used for |
|------------|---------|---------------------|
| **React** | 18.3 | Library for building the user interface with components |
| **TypeScript** | 5.7 | JavaScript with static types (catches errors before execution) |
| **Vite** | 6.0 | Ultra-fast development tool (compiles, reloads instantly) |
| **TailwindCSS** | 3.4 | Utility-class-based styling framework |
| **Zustand** | 5.0 | Global state manager (lightweight alternative to Redux) |
| **TanStack React Query** | 5.62 | Intelligent server data management (cache, retries, etc.) |
| **React Router** | 6.28 | Navigation between pages without reloading |
| **React Hook Form** | 7.54 | Efficient form handling |
| **Zod** | 3.24 | Data validation with typed schemas |
| **Axios** | 1.7 | HTTP client for communicating directly with the 3 external APIs |

### External APIs (no installation needed)

The frontend communicates **directly** with 3 APIs hosted at `dev.abako.xyz`. You do not need to start any server; they are already deployed and accessible via CORS.

| API | Base URL | What it is used for |
|-----|----------|---------------------|
| **Adapter API** | `dev.abako.xyz/adapter/v1` | CRUD for clients, developers, projects, milestones, and calendar |
| **Virto API** | `dev.abako.xyz/api` | WebAuthn authentication, payments, memberships |
| **Contracts API** | `dev.abako.xyz` | Deployment and interaction with smart contracts on the blockchain |

> **Note**: Previously, there was an Express.js backend that acted as an intermediary between the browser and the external APIs. That backend is no longer needed. The React frontend talks directly to the APIs using CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, a browser security mechanism that allows requests between different domains).

---

## General Architecture

### How the application works

```
         USER'S BROWSER
                 |
           React SPA (Vite)
           http://localhost:5173
                 |
         +-------+-------+
         |       |       |
         v       v       v
    Adapter   Virto   Contracts
      API      API      API
         \       |       /
          \      |      /
       dev.abako.xyz (CORS)
```

**Important**: There is no intermediate backend. The browser sends HTTP requests directly to `dev.abako.xyz`. This greatly simplifies the architecture: a single project (the frontend) that communicates with already-deployed APIs.

### The 3 frontend layers

The application is organized into 3 well-defined layers. Each layer has a single responsibility:

```
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  PRESENTATION LAYER (React components, pages, layouts)            |
|  Responsibility: display data and capture interactions            |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
                            |
                    uses hooks and stores
                            |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  SERVICE LAYER (services/)  -  58 business functions              |
|  Responsibility: compose data, orchestrate API calls,             |
|  apply business logic (e.g.: aggregate project with its milestones)|
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
                            |
                  calls API functions
                            |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  API LAYER (api/adapter, api/virto, api/contracts)                |
|  Responsibility: communicate with external APIs via HTTP          |
|  52 functions (adapter) + 17 functions (virto) + 10 (contracts)   |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
                            |
                  Axios HTTP requests
                            |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  dev.abako.xyz  -  3 external APIs (already deployed)             |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### The Service Layer (`frontend/src/services/`)

Services are the **heart of the business logic**. Previously, this logic lived in the backend within the "SEDA layer" (`backend/models/seda/`). It has now been ported to TypeScript and lives directly in the frontend.

**Without services** (bad):
```typescript
// The component calls the API directly and composes data manually
const project = await getProjectInfo(projectId);
const clients = await getClients();
const developers = await getDevelopers();
const milestones = await getAllTasks(projectId);
// ... manual data composition in the component
```

**With services** (good):
```typescript
// The component uses the service, which handles everything internally
import { getProject } from '@/services';
const project = await getProject(projectId);
// The service aggregates project + client + consultant + milestones automatically
```

The service layer has 7 modules with 58 functions in total:

| Module | Functions | Responsibility |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| `projectService.ts` | 15 | Project aggregation, optimized lists with `Promise.allSettled`, flow actions |
| `proposalService.ts` | 2 | Create and update project proposals |
| `clientService.ts` | 8 | Client CRUD, search by email, connection |
| `developerService.ts` | 9 | Developer CRUD, team resolution, search by email |
| `milestoneService.ts` | 10 | Milestone CRUD, reordering, submission/acceptance/rejection |
| `scopeService.ts` | 3 | Submit, accept, and reject scopes |
| `calendarService.ts` | 11 | Worker registration, availability, calendar contracts |

### The API Layer (`frontend/src/api/`)

API functions are **thin wrappers** over Axios that handle: building the correct URL, sending authentication headers, handling errors, and typing responses.

| Module | Functions | External API |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| `api/adapter/` | 52 | Adapter API (`/adapter/v1`) - auth, clients, developers, projects, milestones, calendar |
| `api/virto/` | 17 | Virto API (`/api`) - WebAuthn, payments, memberships |
| `api/contracts/` | 10 | Contracts API - deploy, query, call |
| `api/config.ts` | -- | Centralized URL and endpoint configuration for the 3 APIs |

### Global State with Zustand

We use **Zustand** to manage global state (data that needs to be shared between multiple components). The authentication state is persisted in `localStorage` so that the user does not lose their session when reloading the page.

- **`authStore.ts`**: Stores the authenticated user's information, their token, and their role (client or developer). Uses `zustand/middleware/persist` to save the state in `localStorage` under the key `abako-auth-storage`.

Zustand is much simpler than Redux. Example:

```typescript
// How Zustand is used in a component
import { useAuthStore } from '@/stores/authStore';

function MyComponent() {
  const user = useAuthStore((state) => state.user);
  const isAuthenticated = useAuthStore((state) => state.isAuthenticated);

  if (!isAuthenticated) return <p>You are not logged in</p>;
  return <p>Hello, {user?.name}</p>;
}
```

### Permissions with Pure Functions (`frontend/src/lib/permissions.ts`)

Permissions are calculated with **pure functions** (no side effects, no state). They previously lived in the backend as Express middleware. Now they are TypeScript functions that receive the user and return `true` or `false`.

```typescript
import { isClient, isProjectConsultant, checkPermission } from '@/lib/permissions';
import { useAuthStore } from '@/stores/authStore';

function ProjectActions({ project }) {
  const user = useAuthStore((s) => s.user);

  // Simple check
  if (isClient(user)) { /* show approve button */ }

  // Compound check (allows client OR consultant)
  const allowed = checkPermission(user, {
    projectClient: project.clientId,
    projectConsultant: project.consultantId,
  });
  if (allowed) { /* show actions */ }
}
```

### Server Data with React Query

For data coming from the external APIs (projects, milestones, payments), we use **TanStack React Query**. The hooks call services directly (not a proprietary backend). This gives us:

- **Automatic caching**: If you already loaded the project list, it will not request it from the API again.
- **Retries**: If a request fails, it automatically retries.
- **Background updates**: Data refreshes without the user noticing.

```typescript
// Example: hook that fetches projects directly from the external APIs
import { useProjects } from '@/hooks/useProjects';

function ProjectList() {
  const { data: projects, isLoading, error } = useProjects();

  if (isLoading) return <Spinner />;
  if (error) return <p>Error loading projects</p>;
  return projects.map(p => <ProjectCard key={p.id} project={p} />);
}
```

### Constants and Enums

Reference data (budgets, project types, skills, languages, etc.) is **no longer fetched from the backend**. They are defined as static constants in TypeScript:

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `types/enums.ts` | Budgets, delivery times, project types, skills, roles, availability, proficiency |
| `constants/languages.ts` | Map of 154 ISO 639-3 codes to language names |

This eliminates an HTTP call (previously `GET /api/enums`) and guarantees that forms never show a spinner waiting for options.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed on your computer:

| Tool | Minimum version | How to verify | How to install |
|------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Node.js** | >= 18.0 | `node --version` | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) |
| **npm** | >= 9.0 | `npm --version` | Comes with Node.js |
| **Git** | >= 2.0 | `git --version` | [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) |

> **Note**: Node.js is the runtime that executes JavaScript outside the browser. npm is its package manager (like a library store where you can install packages with a single command). You do not need to install anything else: there is no database, no backend server. You only need Node.js to run Vite (the frontend development tool).

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
# Clone the project to your computer
git clone <URL_DEL_REPOSITORIO>

# Enter the project folder
cd website/website

# Switch to the active working branch
git checkout feature/web-refactor
```

### 2. Install frontend dependencies

```bash
# Enter the frontend folder
cd frontend

# Install all required libraries
npm install
```

### 3. Start the application

```bash
# Inside frontend/
npm run dev
```

It should display something like:
```
  VITE v6.0.3  ready in 300 ms

  > Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

### 4. Open the application

Open your browser and go to **http://localhost:5173**. The React application will communicate directly with the external APIs at `dev.abako.xyz` thanks to CORS. You do not need any backend server.

> **That is all.** A single command (`npm run dev`) and you have the application running. There is no need to configure environment variables, no need to start a backend, no need to install databases.

### Quick summary

```bash
git clone <URL_DEL_REPOSITORIO>
cd website/website/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:5173
```

### Advanced configuration (optional)

If you need to point to a different server (for example, a staging or production environment), you can create a `.env` file in the `frontend/` folder:

```bash
# frontend/.env (optional - defaults to dev.abako.xyz)
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://staging.abako.xyz
```

The base URL configuration is in `frontend/src/api/config.ts`. If you do not create the `.env` file, the app will use `https://dev.abako.xyz` automatically.

---

## Available Scripts

### Frontend (`frontend/package.json`)

| Script | Command | What it does |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| `dev` | `npm run dev` | Starts the Vite development server with hot module replacement (HMR) at `http://localhost:5173` |
| `build` | `npm run build` | Compiles TypeScript and generates the production build in `dist/` |
| `preview` | `npm run preview` | Serves the production build locally for verification before deployment |
| `lint` | `npm run lint` | Runs ESLint with zero warnings allowed |
| `type-check` | `npm run type-check` | Checks TypeScript types without generating files (only checks for errors) |

> **Note**: The most important command is `npm run dev`. It is the one you will use 99% of the time. The others are for verifying quality (`lint`, `type-check`) or preparing deployment (`build`, `preview`).

---

## Migration Status

The project is migrating from **EJS** (HTML templates rendered on the server with an Express backend) to **React SPA** (a modern application that talks directly to external APIs). The migration is divided into phases:

```
Phase 0: Prior fixes                      [##########] 100%  COMPLETED
  - Bugs in flowStates.js fixed
  - Bugs in adapter.js fixed
  - CORS configured on the external APIs
  - Session secret moved to environment variable
  - /backdoor/wild route removed
  - QA passed: 71/71 tests

Phase 1: Infrastructure + API + Services  [##########] 100%  COMPLETED
  - [x] React + Vite + TypeScript scaffold
  - [x] Tailwind CSS configured
  - [x] Complete API layer (52 adapter + 17 virto + 10 contracts)
  - [x] Centralized configuration in api/config.ts
  - [x] React Router configured
  - [x] Zustand auth store with localStorage persistence
  - [x] Complete service layer (58 functions, SEDA port)
  - [x] N+1 optimization with Promise.allSettled in projectService.ts
  - [x] React Query hooks connected to services

Phase 2: Shared logic                     [##########] 100%  COMPLETED
  - [x] Complete TypeScript types (7 files in types/)
  - [x] State machine in TypeScript (lib/flowStates.ts)
  - [x] Static constants in types/enums.ts (no backend call)
  - [x] Language map in constants/languages.ts (154 codes)

Phase 3: Auth + App Shell                 [########--]  80%  NEARLY COMPLETE
  - [x] Main layout (AppLayout, Sidebar, Header)
  - [x] Authentication layout (AuthLayout)
  - [x] 6 auth pages (login/registration for client and developer)
  - [x] Protected routes with ProtectedRoute
  - [x] Error boundaries
  - [x] Permissions ported to pure functions (lib/permissions.ts)
  - [ ] Polish complete WebAuthn flow (integration with Virto SDK)
  - [ ] Authentication tests

Phase 4: Core Pages + Scope              [----------]   0%  PENDING
  ** ATOMIC PHASE - cannot be split **
  - Dashboard, projects, milestones, and scope
  - All must be completed together

Phase 5: Payments + Profiles + Cutover   [----------]   0%  PENDING
  - Fully functional profile pages
  - Payment pages with escrow integration
  - Removal of the EJS system
  - Production deployment
```

> **What "ATOMIC" means**: Phase 4 cannot be done partially. The scope workflow (create milestones, edit, submit for approval) requires that all pages and components are connected. If we complete only half, the application is left in an inconsistent state where the user cannot finish a flow they started.

## :clipboard: TODOs

Concrete tasks ordered by estimated complexity. Each task includes context, files to consult, and acceptance criteria.

---

#### TODO 1: Complete the frontend `.env.example` file

- [ ] Completed

**What to do**: The file `frontend/.env.example` already exists but only documents `VITE_API_BASE_URL`. However, `frontend/.env.local` also uses `VITE_BACKEND_URL`. Your task is to review all the frontend source code, find **all** environment variables that are used (search for `import.meta.env.VITE_`), and document all of them in `.env.example` with clear comments.

**Why it matters**: When a new developer clones the project, the first thing they need is to know which environment variables to configure. If `.env.example` is incomplete, the developer wastes time figuring out why something is not working. A good `.env.example` saves hours of frustration.

**Files to consult**:
- `frontend/.env.example` (current file, incomplete)
- `frontend/.env.local` (has additional variables)
- `frontend/src/api/config.ts` (this is where `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is read)
- Search all of `frontend/src/` with: `grep -r "import.meta.env" frontend/src/`

**Acceptance criteria**:
1. `frontend/.env.example` contains ALL `VITE_*` variables used in the project
2. Each variable has a clear explanatory comment
3. Default values point to the development environment (`dev.abako.xyz`)
4. There are clear instructions at the top of the file on how to use it

**Example of the expected result**:

```bash
# ============================================================
# Variables de entorno para el frontend de Work3Spaces
# ============================================================
# Copia este archivo como .env y ajusta los valores:
#   cp .env.example .env
#
# Para desarrollo local normalmente no necesitas cambiar nada.
# ============================================================

# URL base para todas las APIs externas (Adapter, Virto, Contracts).
# Las 3 APIs viven bajo este dominio.
# En desarrollo: https://dev.abako.xyz
# En produccion: https://abako.xyz (cuando exista)
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://dev.abako.xyz

# URL del backend Express (solo necesario si usas el backend como proxy).
# Dejalo vacio si el frontend se conecta directamente a las APIs.
VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://dev.abako.xyz
```

---

#### TODO 2: Add informative tooltips to project state badges

- [ ] Completed

**What to do**: The `ProjectStateBadge` component displays a colored label for each project state (for example "Proposal Pending" in yellow). It currently does not explain what each state means. Your task is to add a `title` attribute to the badge's `<span>` so that when the user hovers over it, they see a Spanish description of what that state means.

**Why it matters**: New users do not know what "Scope Validation Needed" or "Awaiting Team Assignment" means. A tooltip with a brief explanation saves them from having to read the documentation. It is a small change that greatly improves the user experience.

**Files to consult**:
- `frontend/src/components/shared/ProjectStateBadge.tsx` (the component to modify)
- `frontend/src/lib/flowStates.ts` (definitions of each state with English comments explaining their meaning)

**Acceptance criteria**:
1. Each project state has a `title` with a Spanish description
2. The `title` is displayed as the browser's native tooltip on hover
3. The descriptions are brief (1 line) and clear for a non-technical user
4. The component still renders exactly the same visually (only the tooltip is added)

**Example of the change**:

```typescript
// 1. Create a new Record with the descriptions:
const STATE_TOOLTIPS: Record<ProjectStateValue, string> = {
  [ProjectState.CreationError]: 'Ocurrio un error al crear la propuesta del cliente',
  [ProjectState.ProposalPending]: 'La propuesta fue enviada y esta esperando que la DAO asigne un consultor',
  [ProjectState.WaitingForProposalApproval]: 'Un consultor fue asignado y debe aceptar o rechazar la propuesta',
  [ProjectState.ProposalRejected]: 'El consultor rechazo la propuesta del cliente',
  [ProjectState.ScopingInProgress]: 'El consultor esta definiendo el alcance y los hitos del proyecto',
  [ProjectState.ScopeValidationNeeded]: 'El alcance fue enviado y espera la validacion del cliente',
  [ProjectState.ScopeRejected]: 'El cliente rechazo el alcance propuesto',
  [ProjectState.WaitingForTeamAssigment]: 'El alcance fue aprobado, falta asignar al equipo de desarrollo',
  [ProjectState.ProjectInProgress]: 'El equipo esta trabajando en los hitos del proyecto',
  [ProjectState.PaymentReleased]: 'El pago fue liberado al equipo',
  [ProjectState.Completed]: 'El proyecto fue completado, evaluado y pagado',
  [ProjectState.Invalid]: 'Estado no reconocido',
};

// 2. Use the tooltip in the JSX:
<span
  className={cn('inline-flex items-center ...', colors, className)}
  title={STATE_TOOLTIPS[state]}  // <-- This line is new
>
  {label}
</span>
```

---

#### TODO 3: Create constants for success messages in mutation hooks

- [ ] Completed

**What to do**: Currently, the React Query hooks have success messages written directly in the code (hardcoded), like `'Scope accepted successfully'` or `'Milestone submitted successfully'`. Your task is:
1. Create a new file `frontend/src/constants/messages.ts`
2. Define all message constants there
3. Import and use those constants in the hooks that need them

**Why it matters**: Hardcoded strings are difficult to maintain. If tomorrow we want to change a message, we would have to search across 10 different files. With a centralized file, we change a single line and it updates everywhere. Additionally, this paves the way for future internationalization (i18n).

**Files to consult**:
- `frontend/src/hooks/useScope.ts` (3 messages: submitted, accepted, rejected)
- `frontend/src/hooks/useMilestones.ts` (3 messages: submitted, accepted, rejected)
- `frontend/src/hooks/useVotes.ts` (1 message: submitted)
- `frontend/src/hooks/usePayments.ts` (1 message: released)
- `frontend/src/hooks/useProjects.ts` (1 message: proposal rejected)
- `frontend/src/hooks/useProfile.ts` (1 message: image uploaded)
- `frontend/src/constants/languages.ts` (an existing constants file; use it as a style reference)

**Acceptance criteria**:
1. `frontend/src/constants/messages.ts` exists with all the constants
2. Hooks import the constants instead of using hardcoded strings
3. `grep -rn "successfully" frontend/src/hooks/` returns no results
4. The application works exactly the same

**Example of the file to create**:

```typescript
// frontend/src/constants/messages.ts

/**
 * Centralized success and error messages.
 */

// --- Scope ---
export const SCOPE_SUBMITTED = 'Scope submitted successfully';
export const SCOPE_ACCEPTED = 'Scope accepted successfully';
export const SCOPE_REJECTED = 'Scope rejected successfully';

// --- Milestones ---
export const MILESTONE_SUBMITTED = 'Milestone submitted for review';
export const MILESTONE_ACCEPTED = 'Milestone accepted successfully';
export const MILESTONE_REJECTED = 'Milestone rejected';

// --- Voting ---
export const VOTES_SUBMITTED = 'Votes submitted successfully';

// --- Payments ---
export const PAYMENT_RELEASED = 'Payment released successfully';

// --- Proposals ---
export const PROPOSAL_REJECTED = 'Proposal rejected';

// --- Profile ---
export const PROFILE_IMAGE_UPLOADED = 'Profile image uploaded successfully';
```

**Example of how it is used in a hook**:

```typescript
// frontend/src/hooks/useScope.ts (BEFORE)
return { projectId, message: 'Scope submitted successfully' };

// frontend/src/hooks/useScope.ts (AFTER)
import { SCOPE_SUBMITTED } from '@/constants/messages';
// ...
return { projectId, message: SCOPE_SUBMITTED };
```

#### TODO 4: Add descriptive meta tags to the frontend index.html file

- [ ] Completed

**What to do**: The file `frontend/index.html` has the bare minimum: a `<title>`, a favicon, and the viewport. Your task is to add meta tags for SEO and social media (Open Graph), change `lang` from `"en"` to `"es"`, and improve the title.

**Why it matters**: When someone shares a Work3Spaces link on Slack, Twitter, or WhatsApp, a preview with the title and description is shown. Without meta tags, the preview appears empty or unattractive. Additionally, the `lang="en"` attribute is incorrect because the app is in Spanish, and screen readers (accessibility) use this attribute.

**Files to consult**:
- `frontend/index.html` (the file to modify)
- `frontend/src/main.tsx` (to verify there is no title configuration there)

**Acceptance criteria**:
1. `<html lang="es">` instead of `<html lang="en">`
2. `<title>` reads "Work3Spaces - Marketplace Descentralizado para Freelancers"
3. There is a `description` meta tag with a brief project description
4. There are Open Graph meta tags (`og:title`, `og:description`, `og:type`)
5. The favicon still works

**Example of the change**:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="es">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

    <!-- SEO -->
    <title>Work3Spaces - Marketplace Descentralizado para Freelancers</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Plataforma descentralizada para conectar freelancers con clientes, construida sobre Polkadot y Virto Network. Gestiona proyectos, hitos y pagos con transparencia blockchain." />

    <!-- Open Graph (social media previews) -->
    <meta property="og:title" content="Work3Spaces - Marketplace Descentralizado" />
    <meta property="og:description" content="Conecta con freelancers y gestiona proyectos de forma transparente con tecnologia blockchain." />
    <meta property="og:type" content="website" />

    <!-- Icons and fonts -->
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/remixicon@4.5.0/fonts/remixicon.css" rel="stylesheet" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

---

#### TODO 5: Document the exported functions in services/index.ts with JSDoc

- [ ] Completed

**What to do**: The file `frontend/src/services/index.ts` re-exports all service functions, but has no documentation about what each function does. Your task is to add brief JSDoc comments grouped by category, so that any developer can understand what each function does without having to open the source file.

**Why it matters**: This file is the "index" of everything the frontend can do with the APIs. A new developer arrives and sees 40+ exported functions with no explanation. With clear comments grouped by section, they can quickly find what they need. Additionally, code editors (like VS Code) display JSDoc comments on hover, which speeds up development.

**Files to consult**:
- `frontend/src/services/index.ts` (the file to modify)
- `frontend/src/services/projectService.ts` (to understand what each project function does)
- `frontend/src/services/clientService.ts` (client functions)
- `frontend/src/services/developerService.ts` (developer functions)
- `frontend/src/services/milestoneService.ts` (milestone functions)
- `frontend/src/services/scopeService.ts` (scope functions)
- `frontend/src/services/calendarService.ts` (calendar functions)

**Acceptance criteria**:
1. Each group of exports has a descriptive section comment in Spanish
2. Each exported function has a one-line JSDoc comment explaining what it does
3. Comments are concise (maximum 1-2 lines per function)
4. The file still compiles without errors (`npm run build` passes)

**Example of the change**:

```typescript
// frontend/src/services/index.ts

/**
 * Service Barrel Export
 *
 * Single entry point for all service functions.
 * Services encapsulate business logic over raw API calls.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   import { getProject, createProposal, clientConnect } from '@/services';
 */

// ===================================================================
// Project - Queries, updates, and actions on projects
// ===================================================================

export {
  /** Obtiene los datos completos de un proyecto por su ID. */
  getProject,
  /** Obtiene la lista de proyectos (filtrable por cliente o developer). */
  getProjectsIndex,
  /** Obtiene el ID del cliente asociado a un proyecto. */
  getProjectClientId,
  /** Obtiene el ID del consultor asignado a un proyecto. */
  getProjectConsultantId,
  // ... etc
} from './projectService';
```

> **Tip**: Open each service file, read the function, and write one line summarizing what it does. You do not need to understand all the details, just the general purpose.

---

#### TODO 6: Add loading spinners to all frontend pages

**What to do**: Review the frontend pages (`frontend/src/pages/`) and ensure they all display a spinner (loading indicator) while waiting for data from the external APIs, and an error message when the request fails.

**Why it matters**: Without a loading indicator, the user sees a blank page and thinks the application is broken. A spinner tells them "I am loading, please wait." Similarly, a clear error message tells them something went wrong and they can retry.

**Files to consult**:
- `frontend/src/components/ui/Spinner.tsx` (existing Spinner component)
- `frontend/src/components/shared/LoadingScreen.tsx` (full loading screen)
- `frontend/src/pages/dashboard/DashboardPage.tsx` (page to review)
- `frontend/src/pages/projects/ProjectsPage.tsx` (page to review)
- `frontend/src/pages/payments/PaymentsPage.tsx` (page to review)

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Each page that uses `useQuery` displays a `<Spinner />` or `<LoadingScreen />` during `isLoading`
- [ ] The spinner is centered vertically and horizontally on the screen
- [ ] The existing `Spinner` component is used (do not create a new one)
- [ ] There is a visible error message when `isError` is true
- [ ] `npm run type-check` passes without errors

**Pattern to follow**:
```tsx
import { Spinner } from '@/components/ui';
import { useProjects } from '@/hooks/useProjects';

function MyPage() {
  const { data, isLoading, isError, error } = useProjects();

  if (isLoading) {
    return (
      <div className="flex items-center justify-center h-64">
        <Spinner />
      </div>
    );
  }

  if (isError) {
    return <p className="text-red-500">Error: {error.message}</p>;
  }

  return <div>{/* normal content */}</div>;
}
```

#### TODO 7: Write unit tests for the `flowStates` state machine

**What to do**: Create a test file for `frontend/src/lib/flowStates.ts` that verifies each state transition works correctly.

**What is a unit test**: It is a piece of code that automatically verifies that a function behaves as expected. For example: "if the project is in ProposalPending state and it is approved, it should move to ScopingInProgress."

**Why it matters**: The state machine is the heart of the business logic. If a state is calculated incorrectly, the user sees incorrect buttons or cannot advance in the flow. Tests prevent regressions (something that used to work stops working).

**Files to consult**:
- `frontend/src/lib/flowStates.ts` (the state machine to test)
- `backend/models/flowStates.js` (original JavaScript version, for comparison)
- `.context/PROJECT_ANALYSIS.md` (section 5: State Machines, describes all flows)

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] A file `frontend/src/lib/__tests__/flowStates.test.ts` (or similar) exists
- [ ] All ProjectState transitions are tested (at least 8 transitions)
- [ ] All MilestoneState transitions are tested (at least 5 transitions)
- [ ] Edge cases are tested: invalid state, disallowed transition
- [ ] All tests pass with `npm test` (may need to configure Vitest first)

> **Note**: If Vitest is not configured yet, this TODO includes installing and configuring it. You can follow the [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/guide/) guide.

---

#### TODO 8: Add unit tests for the permission functions

**What to do**: Create tests for `frontend/src/lib/permissions.ts` that verify each permission function returns the correct value based on the user and context.

**What is `permissions.ts`**: These are pure functions that determine whether a user can perform an action. For example: "only the client who proposed the project can approve the scope" or "only the assigned consultant can create milestones."

**Why it matters**: Permissions define the application's security. If `isProjectClient` returns `true` for a user who is not the client, that user could approve a scope that does not belong to them. Tests ensure this does not happen.

**Files to consult**:
- `frontend/src/lib/permissions.ts` (7 functions + 1 compound function)
- `frontend/src/types/user.ts` (the `User` type received by the functions)
- `backend/controllers/permission.js` (original version for comparison)

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] A file `frontend/src/lib/__tests__/permissions.test.ts` exists
- [ ] All 7 functions are tested: `isClient`, `isDeveloper`, `isClientSelf`, `isDeveloperSelf`, `isProjectClient`, `isProjectConsultant`, `isMilestoneDeveloper`
- [ ] The compound function `checkPermission` is tested with multiple combinations
- [ ] Cases with `user = null` (not authenticated) are tested
- [ ] All tests pass

**Test example**:
```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { isClient, isDeveloper, checkPermission } from '../permissions';
import type { User } from '@/types';

const clientUser: User = { clientId: 'client-1', name: 'Ana' } as User;
const devUser: User = { developerId: 'dev-1', name: 'Carlos' } as User;

describe('isClient', () => {
  it('returns true for a user with clientId', () => {
    expect(isClient(clientUser)).toBe(true);
  });
  it('returns false for a developer', () => {
    expect(isClient(devUser)).toBe(false);
  });
  it('returns false for null', () => {
    expect(isClient(null)).toBe(false);
  });
});
```

#### TODO 9: Improve the ErrorBoundary component

**What to do**: Improve the existing `ErrorBoundary.tsx` to display a friendly message, a "Retry" button, and log the error to the console. Ensure it properly wraps the key sections of the application.

**What is an Error Boundary**: It is a React component that "catches" errors in its children. Without it, an error in a component breaks the ENTIRE page. With it, only the affected section shows an error message and the rest of the app keeps working.

**Why it matters**: In production, an uncaught error shows a blank screen. An Error Boundary shows a friendly message and can offer a "retry" button.

**Files to consult**:
- `frontend/src/components/shared/ErrorBoundary.tsx` (existing implementation)
- `frontend/src/App.tsx` (where boundaries should be placed)
- `frontend/src/components/layouts/AppLayout.tsx` (another key placement point)

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] The `ErrorBoundary` displays a friendly (non-technical) error message
- [ ] Includes a "Retry" button that clears the error and re-renders
- [ ] At minimum, it wraps: the main layout content, each individual page
- [ ] The error is logged with `console.error` for debugging
- [ ] Works with asynchronous errors (combined with React Query `ErrorBoundary`)

---

#### TODO 10: Add form validation with Zod schemas

**What to do**: Create Zod validation schemas for the frontend forms and connect them with React Hook Form using `@hookform/resolvers`.

**What is Zod**: A validation library that lets you define "the shape" your data must have. For example: "the name is a string of at least 2 characters and the email must be in email format."

**Why it matters**: Without validation, a user can submit an empty form or one with incorrect data, causing errors in the external APIs. Frontend validation provides immediate feedback before submission.

**Files to consult**:
- `frontend/package.json` (Zod and `@hookform/resolvers` are already installed)
- `frontend/src/pages/projects/CreateProjectPage.tsx` (create project form)
- `frontend/src/pages/auth/ClientRegisterPage.tsx` (registration form)
- `frontend/src/types/project.ts` (existing types to base schemas on)
- `frontend/src/types/enums.ts` (option constants: BUDGETS, PROJECT_TYPES, etc.)

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] At least 2 forms have complete Zod validation
- [ ] Error messages are in Spanish and user-friendly
- [ ] Required fields, formats, and minimum/maximum lengths are validated
- [ ] Errors are displayed below each field (not as a generic alert)
- [ ] Zod schemas are in separate files (e.g.: `frontend/src/lib/schemas/`)

**Example**:
```typescript
import { z } from 'zod';
import { BUDGETS, DELIVERY_TIMES, PROJECT_TYPES } from '@/types/enums';

export const createProjectSchema = z.object({
  title: z.string()
    .min(5, 'El titulo debe tener al menos 5 caracteres')
    .max(100, 'El titulo no puede superar 100 caracteres'),
  description: z.string()
    .min(20, 'La descripcion debe tener al menos 20 caracteres'),
  budget: z.enum(BUDGETS, {
    errorMap: () => ({ message: 'Debes seleccionar un presupuesto' }),
  }),
  deliveryTime: z.enum(DELIVERY_TIMES, {
    errorMap: () => ({ message: 'Debes seleccionar un tiempo de entrega' }),
  }),
  projectType: z.enum(PROJECT_TYPES, {
    errorMap: () => ({ message: 'Debes seleccionar un tipo de proyecto' }),
  }),
});

export type CreateProjectInput = z.infer<typeof createProjectSchema>;
```

#### TODO 11: Create Storybook stories for the UI components

**What to do**: Install Storybook and create stories for the existing components in `frontend/src/components/ui/` (Button, Card, Input, Label, Spinner).

**What is Storybook**: It is a tool that allows developing and testing components in isolation, outside of the application. Each "story" shows a variant of the component (primary button, disabled button, danger button, etc.).

**Why it matters**: It allows viewing all design system components in one place, testing variants without navigating through the entire app, and serves as visual documentation for the team.

**Files to consult**:
- `frontend/src/components/ui/Button.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/ui/Card.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/ui/Input.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/ui/Label.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/ui/Spinner.tsx`

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Storybook is installed and works with `npm run storybook`
- [ ] Each component in `ui/` has at least 3 stories (different variants)
- [ ] Stories show all possible props of the component
- [ ] Stories for states are included: default, hover, disabled, loading
- [ ] Basic documentation is included in each story (usage description)

#### TODO 12: Add integration tests for the services

**What to do**: Create tests for the services in `frontend/src/services/` that verify data composition works correctly. Use mocks for the API layer functions.

**What is an integration test**: Unlike a unit test (which tests an isolated function), an integration test verifies that multiple pieces work together. In this case, we verify that a service calls the correct API functions and composes the expected data.

**Why it matters**: Services are the most critical layer of the application. If `getProject` does not correctly aggregate milestones, the detail page shows incomplete data. Tests with mocks allow testing the logic without depending on external APIs.

**Files to consult**:
- `frontend/src/services/projectService.ts` (the `getProject` function is ideal for testing)
- `frontend/src/services/clientService.ts` (simpler functions to start with)
- `frontend/src/api/adapter/index.ts` (functions that need to be mocked)

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] At least 2 services have integration tests
- [ ] API functions are mocked (no real HTTP calls are made)
- [ ] It is tested that `getProject` aggregates project + client + consultant + milestones
- [ ] It is tested that `getProjectsIndex` uses `Promise.allSettled` and does not fail if a request fails
- [ ] All tests pass with `npm test`

**Example**:
```typescript
import { describe, it, expect, vi } from 'vitest';
import { getProject } from '../projectService';

// Mock the API module
vi.mock('@/api/adapter', () => ({
  getProjectInfo: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue({
    _id: 'proj-1', clientId: 'client-1', consultantId: 'dev-1', creationStatus: 'created',
  }),
  getClients: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue({
    clients: [{ id: 'client-1', name: 'Ana' }],
  }),
  getDevelopers: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue({
    developers: [{ id: 'dev-1', name: 'Carlos' }],
  }),
  getAllTasks: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue({
    milestones: [{ _id: 'm-1', title: 'Hito 1', developerId: 'dev-1' }],
  }),
}));

describe('getProject', () => {
  it('aggregates client, consultant, and milestones into the project', async () => {
    const project = await getProject('proj-1');
    expect(project.client?.name).toBe('Ana');
    expect(project.consultant?.name).toBe('Carlos');
    expect(project.milestones).toHaveLength(1);
  });
});
```

#### TODO 13: Implement pagination and search in the project list

**What to do**: Add client-side pagination and a search field to the `ProjectsPage.tsx` page. Since the external API does not support native pagination, the implementation will be on the frontend: all projects are loaded once and paginated/filtered locally.

**Why it matters**: Currently ALL projects are displayed at once. With 100+ projects, the page will be slow and hard to navigate. Pagination shows only a portion (e.g., 10 projects at a time) and search allows quickly finding a specific project.

**Files to consult**:
- `frontend/src/pages/projects/ProjectsPage.tsx` (page to modify)
- `frontend/src/hooks/useProjects.ts` (hook that fetches data)
- `frontend/src/services/projectService.ts` (service that loads projects)

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] The page displays 10 projects at a time (configurable)
- [ ] Pagination controls exist (previous/next, page numbers)
- [ ] The search field filters by project title or description
- [ ] React Query maintains the cache correctly
- [ ] The experience is smooth (no flickering or reloads)

---

#### TODO 14: Complete the Dashboard pages with real data

**What to do**: Connect `DashboardPage.tsx` with the React Query hooks so that it displays real data from the external APIs: count of active projects, pending milestones, recent payments, and summary by state.

**Why it matters**: The dashboard is the first page a user sees when they log in. It may currently be showing placeholder data. Connecting it with real data is fundamental for the application to be functional.

**Files to consult**:
- `frontend/src/pages/dashboard/DashboardPage.tsx` (page to complete)
- `frontend/src/hooks/useProjects.ts` (project data)
- `frontend/src/hooks/usePayments.ts` (payment data)
- `frontend/src/services/projectService.ts` (the `getProjectsIndex` function)
- `frontend/src/lib/flowStates.ts` (for grouping projects by state)

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] The dashboard displays a real count of projects by state (pending, in progress, completed)
- [ ] Shows the last 5 projects with links to their detail page
- [ ] Shows milestones pending review (if consultant) or pending approval (if client)
- [ ] Correctly handles loading and error states
- [ ] The view differs between client and developer using `permissions.ts`

#### TODO 15: Add E2E (End-to-End) tests with Playwright

**What to do**: Configure Playwright and implement tests that simulate a complete user flow: register, view the project list, navigate to a project's detail, etc.

**What is an E2E test**: Unlike a unit test (which tests an isolated function), an E2E test opens a real browser, clicks buttons, fills in forms, and verifies the page displays what is expected. It simulates a real user.

**Why it matters**: It is the only way to verify that all components work correctly together: navigation, data loading, permissions, forms, etc. A unit test can pass but the app can still be broken if the components do not integrate well.

**Files to consult**:
- `frontend/src/App.tsx` (application routes)
- `frontend/src/pages/auth/LoginPage.tsx` (first flow to test)
- `frontend/src/pages/projects/ProjectsPage.tsx` (second flow to test)
- [Playwright documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro)

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Playwright is installed and configured
- [ ] A script `npm run test:e2e` exists in the frontend
- [ ] At least 3 E2E flows are implemented: login, view projects, navigate to detail
- [ ] Tests can be run against the development environment (`dev.abako.xyz`)
- [ ] Documentation on how to run the tests is included

#### TODO 16: Implement Zustand devtools and state monitoring

**What to do**: Add debugging tools for Zustand state: integrate with Redux DevTools Extension, add development logging, and create a second store if needed (for example `uiStore` for interface state like sidebar open/closed, theme, etc.).

**Why it matters**: As the application grows, it is important to be able to inspect global state for debugging issues. Zustand supports Redux DevTools, which allows viewing the history of state changes in the browser.

**Files to consult**:
- `frontend/src/stores/authStore.ts` (existing store as reference)
- [Zustand middleware documentation](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand#devtools)

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] `authStore` is connected to Redux DevTools (visible in the browser extension)
- [ ] Conditional logging is added in development (`import.meta.env.DEV`)
- [ ] A `uiStore.ts` is created if there is repeated UI state across multiple components
- [ ] `npm run type-check` passes without errors

---

#### TODO 17: Review and adjust the UI design to match the Figma mockups

- [ ] Completed

**What to do**: Compare every page and component in the frontend against the original Figma designs and fix any visual discrepancies. This includes spacing, typography, colors, component sizing, layout alignment, responsive breakpoints, and any missing UI elements. The goal is pixel-level fidelity with the Figma source of truth.

**Why it matters**: During the migration from EJS to React, the focus was on functional correctness (data flow, API calls, state management). Visual styling was implemented with Tailwind utility classes but was not systematically compared against the Figma designs. The current UI may have misaligned elements, incorrect spacing, wrong color shades, or missing visual details that affect the professional look and feel of the product.

**Files to consult**:
- The Figma project (ask the team lead for the link if you do not have access)
- `frontend/src/components/layouts/AppLayout.tsx` (main layout: sidebar + header + content area)
- `frontend/src/components/layouts/Sidebar.tsx` (navigation sidebar)
- `frontend/src/components/layouts/Header.tsx` (top header bar)
- `frontend/src/components/layouts/AuthLayout.tsx` (login/register layout)
- `frontend/src/components/ui/` (Button, Card, Input, Label, Spinner — design system primitives)
- `frontend/src/pages/dashboard/DashboardPage.tsx` (dashboard)
- `frontend/src/pages/projects/ProjectsPage.tsx` (project list)
- `frontend/src/pages/projects/ProjectDetailPage.tsx` (project detail)
- `frontend/src/pages/projects/CreateProjectPage.tsx` (create project form)
- `frontend/src/pages/payments/PaymentsPage.tsx` (payments list)
- `frontend/src/pages/profiles/ClientProfilePage.tsx` (client profile)
- `frontend/src/pages/profiles/DeveloperProfilePage.tsx` (developer profile)
- `frontend/src/pages/auth/LoginPage.tsx` (login page)
- `frontend/src/pages/auth/ClientRegisterPage.tsx` (client registration)
- `frontend/src/pages/auth/DeveloperRegisterPage.tsx` (developer registration)
- `frontend/tailwind.config.js` (Tailwind theme: colors, fonts, breakpoints)

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Every page has been compared side-by-side with its Figma counterpart
- [ ] Colors, typography (font family, size, weight), and spacing match the Figma design tokens
- [ ] Layout structure (sidebar width, header height, content margins) matches the mockups
- [ ] UI components (buttons, cards, inputs, badges) match the Figma component library
- [ ] Responsive behavior (mobile, tablet, desktop) follows the Figma breakpoints
- [ ] Any missing visual elements from Figma (icons, dividers, shadows, hover states) are added
- [ ] `npm run build` passes without errors

## How to test
1. Go to /projects/new
2. Try to submit the form empty -> errors should appear on each field
3. Fill in correctly -> should submit without issues

## Key files
- frontend/src/lib/schemas/createProject.ts (NEW)
- frontend/src/pages/projects/CreateProjectPage.tsx (MODIFIED)
```
